# Gif animation search application
This is a compact and easy-to-use and aesthetically appealing demonstration of a gif search application. Users have the ability to search for GIFs and click on the gif they like on the GIPHY website.
My goal was to develop a modern UI/UX design from scratch: from design concept to implementation.
